This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites
yarn `~1.19.1`

If you don't already have `yarn`, full instructions can be found on the official [yarn installation page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

### Run `yarn` first

To install all the project dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

## IE support
`create-react-app` in development mode doesn't play well with older IE versions; if you want to view the app in IE versions 10+, you can run `yarn build`, then once that is complete you can follow in-terminal instructions to use the `serve` package. This will enable you to view the full production app even in IE 10.
